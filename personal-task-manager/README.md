# Personal Task Manager (Web)

Project documentation lives in the repository root (`../README.md`) so it is visible on GitHub by default.

If you are already inside this directory, run commands with:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Refer to the root README for detailed feature descriptions, architecture notes, and testing instructions.
